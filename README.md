# AI-ML
Aritificial Intelligence is process of simulating human like intelligence on a machine which can be used in various problem solving and decision making challenges. 

The data set for each of model is collectivly stored in a singular dataset file : [Data Set](https://github.com/NeoMorpheus99/AI-ML/tree/main/Data%20Set)

This Repo contains some samples of ML models that I have worked on. Please Feel free to correct me where I am wrong and if there are optimizations that can be done, feel free to pull request:
