# AI-ML
Aritificial Intelligence is process of simulating human like intelligence on a machine which can be used in various problem solving and decision making challenges. 

The data set for each of model is collectivly stored in a singular dataset file : [Data Set](https://github.com/NeoMorpheus99/AI-ML/tree/main/Dataset)

This Repo contains some samples of ML models. Some of the Projects built are:
